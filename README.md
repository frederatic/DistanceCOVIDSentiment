# DistanceCOVIDSentiment
Code and data used in a study on how spatial distance to COVID impacts Twitter sentiment

The codes are numbered in the order they were run in our study.
x contains the full list of IDs the final study ended up with after all the cleaning.
Twitter does not allow the sharing of Twitter data, thus only IDs could be shared. The IDs can be hydrated either using Twarc in Python or this Hydrator tool.
The code in this repository can then be run in turn on the acquired Twitter data to obtain our final dataset.
Variables of the final dataset are explained in the txt file.
